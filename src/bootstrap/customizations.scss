/*
This gets loaded after bootstrap variables is loaded.
Thus, you may customize Bootstrap variables based on the values established in the Bootstrap _variables.scss file.
Note, if bootstrap did not have derived values, it would not be necessary to have two config files for customizing bootstrap values.

If you want your bootstrap override value to apply to derived variable values, then place your customizations in preBootstrapCustomizations.
If you want to be sure your changes don't affect other derived values, place the changes in bootstrapCustomizations.

If you are not sure, you can probably simply use preBootstrapCustomizations and, if you have issues, see _variables.scss for derived values.
